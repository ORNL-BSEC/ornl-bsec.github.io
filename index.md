## ORNL-Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing Group

The [Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csed/biomedical-sciences) (BSEC) group 
at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov) catalyzes interdisciplinary biomedical research on national medical 
challenges that is synergistic with the DOE mission and ORNL capabilities. Supporting DOEâ€™s strategic goal for improved 
US economic competitiveness and quality of life through innovations in science and technology, the group brings together 
scientists to solve challenging biomedical problems that can benefit from the unique ORNL resources: 
(i) broad spectrum of core expertise in physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, engineering, and computer science; 
(ii) leading high performance computing infrastructure, specialized equipment, and sophisticated instrumentation; 
(iii) proven platform for productive multidisciplinary collaborations with academia, industry, medical centers, 
and federal agencies; 
and (iv) experienced technology transfer for commercialization and licensing.  

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a multi-program science and technology laboratory managed for the U.S. Department of Energy 
by UT-Battelle, LLC. Scientists and engineers at ORNL conduct basic and applied research and development to create scientific 
knowledge and technological solutions that strengthen the nation's leadership in key areas of science; increase the 
availability of clean, abundant energy; restore and protect the environment; and contribute to national security.
