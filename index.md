## ORNL-Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing Group

The [Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csed/biomedical-sciences) (BSEC) group 
at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov) catalyzes interdisciplinary biomedical research on national medical 
challenges that is synergistic with the DOE mission and ORNL capabilities. 

Our ongoing projects and the respective links to the software are listed below. Feel free to take a look around. Each project has the contact information for the developers and feel free to communicate with them to get a sense of how to use their code or develop around these projects.  
* [Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C)](https://ncip.nci.nih.gov/blog/joint-design-advanced-computing-solutions-cancer-jdacs4c-right-collaboration-right-time-accelerate-cancer-research/). ORNL is the lead for Pilot 3: Population scale
