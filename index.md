## ORNL-Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing Group

The [Biomedical Sciences, Engineering and Computing](https://www.ornl.gov/division/csed/biomedical-sciences) (BSEC) group 
at [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](http://www.ornl.gov) catalyzes interdisciplinary biomedical research on national medical 
challenges that is synergistic with the DOE mission and ORNL capabilities. 

Our ongoing projects with the [Joint Design of Advanced Computing Solutions for Cancer (JDACS4C)](https://ncip.nci.nih.gov/blog/joint-design-advanced-computing-solutions-cancer-jdacs4c-right-collaboration-right-time-accelerate-cancer-research/) and the [Exascale Computing Project's Cancer Deep Learning Environment](https://press3.mcs.anl.gov/candle/) are provided here. 

Oak Ridge National Laboratory is a multi-program science and technology laboratory managed for the U.S. Department of Energy 
by UT-Battelle, LLC. Scientists and engineers at ORNL conduct basic and applied research and development to create scientific 
knowledge and technological solutions that strengthen the nation's leadership in key areas of science; increase the 
availability of clean, abundant energy; restore and protect the environment; and contribute to national security.
